          <p>
            Each event's CFP will include essential information that you need to
            carefully consider before preparing your submission. Key details
            typically covered include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Submission Deadlines:</strong> Know the exact date and time
              by which proposals must be submitted to be considered.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Event Date and Location:</strong> Be sure the event timing
              and venue work for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Additional Guidelines:</strong> These may include expectations
              about content, style, or how to handle co-speakers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong class="text-warning">Why This Matters: </strong>Reviewing
            the CFP details ensures your proposal meets the event's criteria and
            aligns with the audience's expectations, increasing its relevance
            and chance of acceptance.

            To submit your proposal, start by clicking the “Submit a Proposal”
            button on the event's Call for Papers page. This will open a
            structured four-step submission form designed to guide you through
            the entire process smoothly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each step of the form captures essential details to help organizers
            understand your topic, background, and how your talk fits into the
            event. Even if you're submitting for the first time, the process is
            simple and speaker-friendly.

                </li>
                <li>
