          <h2 class="mb-2">What to Look For in a CFP Description</h2>
          <p>
            Each event’s CFP will include essential information that you need to
            carefully consider before preparing your submission. Key details
            typically covered include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Submission Deadlines:</strong> Know the exact date and time
              by which proposals must be submitted to be considered.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Event Date and Location:</strong> Be sure the event timing
              and venue work for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Event Theme and Focus:</strong> Understand the topics and themes
              the event emphasizes. Align your talk to the community’s interests.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Who Can Submit:</strong> Some events are open to all, others
              might target specific roles or experience levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Presentation Formats:</strong> Pay attention to the available
              talk lengths and formats (e.g., 15, 30, 45 minutes, or workshops).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Categories:</strong> CFPs often list categories to help you
              choose where your proposal fits best.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Additional Guidelines:</strong> These may include expectations
              about content, style, or how to handle co-speakers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="mb-1">Why This Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Reading and understanding the CFP details ensures that your proposal
            meets the event’s criteria and increases your chances of acceptance.
            It also helps you tailor your submission to the community and format
            expectations, making your talk more impactful and relevant.

            the entire process smoothly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each step of the form captures essential details to help organizers
            understand your topic, background, and how your talk fits into the
            event. Even if you're submitting for the first time, the process is
            simple and speaker-friendly.

                <li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Level:</strong> Choose the appropriate level of difficulty

            speaker. Here are some proven tips to help you present your ideas
            clearly, engage the reviewers, and maximize your chances of being

            the community.
          </p>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Be Clear and Concise:</strong> Your title and abstract are
                often the first things reviewers and attendees see. Make sure they
                clearly convey what your talk is about and what the audience will
                gain. Avoid jargon or vague phrases, and focus on the core message.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Focus on Value and Relevance:</strong> Emphasize the practical
                value your talk will provide. Share real-world lessons, actionable
                insights, or innovative ideas that resonate with the event’s theme
                and audience interests. Remember, Fork it! is all about honest, no-nonsense
                discussions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Choose the Right Level of Difficulty:</strong> Your title
                and abstract are often the first things reviewers and attendees see.
                Make sure they clearly convey what your talk is about and what the
                audience will gain. Avoid jargon or vague phrases, and focus on the
                core message.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Be Clear and Concise:</strong> Be honest about the difficulty
                and experience level of your talk's targets (Beginner, Intermediate,
                or Advanced). This helps organizers create a balanced schedule and
                ensures your talk reaches the right audience.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Structure Your Proposal Thoughtfully:</strong> Outline what
                attendees can expect. Briefly describe the flow of your talk—introduction,
                key points, and conclusion or takeaways. A well-structured proposal
                shows you’ve thought through your content.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Highlight Your Expertise:</strong> Use the biography section
                to introduce yourself and establish credibility. Share your background,
                relevant experience, and what makes you passionate about the topic.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Prepare for questions:</strong> All standard talk formats
                include time for questions. Think about potential audience questions
                and how you might address them—it shows readiness and confidence.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Avoid Sales Pitches:</strong> Fork it! values transparency
                and authenticity. Avoid marketing-heavy content or overt promotion.
                Focus on sharing knowledge, experiences, and insights.
