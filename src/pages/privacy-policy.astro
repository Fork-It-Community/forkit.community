      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Fork it! Community ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting
        your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
        disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Privacy-First Approach:</strong> Our website does not maintain its
        own user database. We partner with trusted third-party services (Luma for
        events, Brevo for newsletters) to handle personal data collection and storage.
        Analytics and marketing tools require your explicit consent before activation.
      </p>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-we-use-your-information">How We Use Your Information</h2>
