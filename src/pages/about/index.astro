            Conferences should be about sharing knowledge, learning from each
            other, and building community—not about selling products. We believe
            in fostering authentic connections and offering spaces where
            developers and tech enthusiasts can come together to exchange ideas,
            collaborate, and grow.
          </p>

          <p>
            We organize a variety of <a href="/events">events</a> and content to
            engage the community, including <strong>meetups</strong>,
            multi-track <strong>conferences</strong>, hands-on <strong
              >hackathons</strong
            >, and <strong>off-trail gatherings</strong> in unique locations. We
            also produce <a href="/podcasts"><strong>podcasts</strong></a> featuring
            insightful conversations with industry experts, with more formats to
            come as we continue to grow and evolve. Each initiative is designed to
            promote learning, collaboration, and creativity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our values are simple: no marketing-driven talks, no unnecessary
            distractions—just real conversations and learning. We’re committed
            to inclusivity, offering live translations to support non-English
            speakers, and keeping ticket prices low or free to ensure
            accessibility for all.
          </p>

          <p>
            Run by developers with real-world experience in event organization,
            we aim to create spaces where knowledge flows freely, and everyone
            feels welcome. Whether it’s a local meetup, a global conference, or
            engaging content online, we invite you to join us in building a
            community where learning comes first.
