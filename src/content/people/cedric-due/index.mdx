A passionate full-stack developer with over 20 years of experience, Cédric has always enjoyed writing code and designing software architectures with care and purpose.
After more than a decade working on large-scale applications and web systems for a major enterprise, he joined a startup where he spent several years building products
hands-on before stepping into the role of VP of Engineering.

For the last few years, he has been working as a freelance engineer [@ysely](https://www.ysely.io/), helping teams design, build, and improve their systems in fast-changing environments.
Strongly committed to solid engineering fundamentals, he is also fascinated by the opportunities unlocked by AI-assisted development and its influence on how software is and
will be designed and created.
