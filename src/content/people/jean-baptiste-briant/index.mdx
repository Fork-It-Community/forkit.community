Jean-Baptiste's journey into technology started at 21, though his dream of making video games had been with him since he was just 7 years old.
Driven by this childhood goal, he spent an intense decade teaching himself, learning software engineering from scratch. His skills in backend systems,
APIs, and databases helped him build a successful career as a freelancer in web development. But the pull of game creation was strong, and he eventually
switched paths, combining his technical know-how with his lifelong passion. Now, Jean-Baptiste wears many hats in his work - from detailed system design
and art direction to sales strategy, video production, and marketing. This mix of roles shows his main goal: to constantly innovate and push the limits
of what's possible in both technology and creativity. Jean-Baptiste casually streams his work on Twitch, sharing his process with aspiring developers.
His love for Thailand made him an immigrant to the land of smile. Currently, Jean-Baptiste is pouring his expertise and passion into a video game
named Ardaria. For those eager to see his vision coming to life, a demo of Ardaria is available on Steam, offering a taste of the innovation and
creativity Jean-Baptiste brings to the gaming world.
