Ba Ngoc is the Founder/CEO of ProtonX and the Founder of VietAI Hanoi. He loves programming and machine learning and strongly believes that “Machines are capable of getting past the limits of human speed in the future”.

In 2019, Ngoc was recognized by Google as the first Google Developers Expert in Machine Learning in Vietnam and the 66th all around the world.
