Erwan Rougeux is a long-time open source advocate, hacker at heart, and systems architect with a passion for building resilient and sovereign infrastructures.

A trained engineer and former Chief Information Officer of a major global education network, he spent over a decade deploying robust and intelligent solutions for schools and institutions across West Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. His journey has always been grounded in free software, automation, and a taste for elegant simplicity — whether crafting industrial IoT systems, hacking smart homes, or architecting secure infrastructure.

Deeply involved in cybersecurity and digital sovereignty issues, Erwan is now Vice President of International Growth at Clever Cloud, a European PaaS provider committed to building strategic autonomy in cloud computing. He works across continents to deploy open infrastructure, support local innovation ecosystems, and empower public and private actors with trusted tech.

Erwan speaks frequently about infrastructure, decentralization, DevOps culture, Tor and privacy, and the future of automation — always with humor, clarity, and a deep respect for community-driven tech.
