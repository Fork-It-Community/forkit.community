Mathias Arlaud is a member of the Symfony Core Team and a passionate advocate for clean, maintainable PHP architecture. Known for his pragmatic approach to software design, Mathias has contributed significantly to the Symfony ecosystem. He is the creator of two core Symfony components: JsonStreamer, a low-memory JSON parser designed for handling large data streams efficiently, and TypeInfo, which brings first-class introspection and type system support to Symfony.

He is also a regular speaker at conferences, where he shares his insights on domain modeling, modern Symfony features, and long-term maintainability. His talks reflect a strong focus on practical architecture, business-oriented design, and the evolving capabilities of the Symfony framework.
