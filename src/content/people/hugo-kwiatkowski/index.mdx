My main occupation is studying law at Rouen university, however in my free time I contribute to OpenStreetMap and learn about urban planning.
I started to contribute to OpenStreetMap after discovering great alternatives to Google Maps, which incited me to improve the way my own city was mapped. Since June 2025, I'm also a board member of OpenStreetMap France, the national-level association promoting the OpenStreetMap project.
