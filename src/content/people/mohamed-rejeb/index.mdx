As a Kotlin tech lead at Softylines, I lead the development of innovative mobile applications using Compose UI and Kotlin. I collaborate with a team of talented developers, designers, and product managers to deliver high-quality products that meet the needs and expectations of our clients and users. I also mentor and coach junior developers, sharing my knowledge and experience in mobile development.

In addition to my work at Softylines, I am an active open source contributor and a library author. I have created and maintained several popular libraries that help other developers use Kotlin and Compose more effectively. I am passionate about learning new technologies and skills and applying them to solve real-world problems. My goal is to become a leader and an innovator in the mobile development industry.
