I've been working as a blockchain engineer for the past three years, building and reviewing production systems where security mistakes have real consequences.

Through this work, I've seen how familiar security practices can behave very differently once systems are deployed on a blockchain — where code is public, changes are hard to make, and assumptions are quickly tested by real users and attackers.

I'm particularly interested in the gap between how systems are designed and how they actually behave in production, and how small decisions around trust, access, and responsibility can turn into serious security issues.

I enjoy sharing practical lessons learned from real projects, focusing on what went wrong, what helped, and what I would do differently next time — without hype or theory.
