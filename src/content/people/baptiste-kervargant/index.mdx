As a passionate UX/UI designer, I love transforming ideas into intuitive and fun experiences. 
I enjoy conveying this creative energy by showing that behind games and apps, there are always paths, 
choices, and ingenious solutions. My goal with Fork it! For Kids is to inspire children to understand, imagine, and 
create for themselves!
