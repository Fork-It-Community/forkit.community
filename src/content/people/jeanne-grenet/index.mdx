Jeanne became a frontend developer at Bear Studio after years of loving math. This passion fuels her constant desire to learn new things,
seven when it comes to backend technologies! As an organiser of the Fork it! Community, she's realised that she enjoys conferences and meeting new people just as much as coding.
