I'm Med Ali Dridi, an electromechanical engineer who graduated in 2020. After discovering my passion for technology, I transitioned to IT through a bootcamp, which led me to found KOYOTEC, a creative and high-tech digital agency in Tunisia. My agency specializes in Next.js, React, GSAP animations, and Three.js, delivering innovative web solutions that stand out in a market where creativity is rare.

In 2024, I decided to return to IT engineering to expand my knowledge in machine learning, with a specific goal: creating a model that helps defend against scleroderma. My background in both engineering and AI-driven technologies allows me to approach complex challenges from a unique perspective.

Through KOYOTEC, I've worked on international projects, including digital marketing in the Canadian market and web solutions for industries like aesthetic clinics and decoration businesses. I also focus on social media Reels as a powerful marketing tool to grow businesses and engage audiences.

Beyond my agency, I’m also an influencer on Instagram, where I share insights on technology, business, and digital trends. With a deep passion for innovation, cybersecurity, and high-performance web development, I’m always pushing the limits to create impactful digital experiences.
