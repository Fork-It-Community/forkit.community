Hend has a unique background that bridges the gap between people and tech. Originally trained in the humanities, she made a shift toward a more technical
role — but never lost sight of what matters most to her: the human side. Today, she leads a team, helping them overcome challenges, grow together,
and unlock their full potential.
At Fork It!, her mission takes a different shape: making sure every event is a success for both speakers and attendees. From logistics to curation,
Hend ensures everything runs smoothly — with one goal in mind: building meaningful connections and growing the tech community in Tunisia and beyond.
