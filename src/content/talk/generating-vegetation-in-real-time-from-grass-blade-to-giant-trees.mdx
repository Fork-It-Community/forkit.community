I leveraged the best of all worlds to create a system of unmatched performance in Unreal Engine. Itâ€™s versatile, highly customizable, ultra fast and precise. It was a nightmare of 800 hours to code, the first time ever in my decade+ career that I doubted my capacity to just even conceive the software, not mentioning implementing the solution.

I used industry grade lock-free task queue in C++ in a multithreaded environment, coupled with Unreal Engine PCG framework to achieve what No Man Sky achieved. But as a solo developer.
