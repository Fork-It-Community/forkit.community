In my 30-minute presentation, I'll discuss my transition from architecture to UX design. I'll explore the parallels between these fields and share the valuable lessons I've learned. I'll emphasize the importance of recognizing and utilizing the skills I already had in the new field.

I'll also talk about the importance of empathy and recognicing the similar thinking approaches between both architecture and UX design. Understanding what users need and how they behave is crucial for designing spaces and digital interfaces that people feel confortable to use.

Through real-world examples and practical tips, I aim to highlight that UX designers can draw inspiration from diverse backgrounds and contexts, all that is required is to think outside of the box.
