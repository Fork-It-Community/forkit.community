One of the existing solution to avoid AI hallucinations and constant tunning, is RAG, but this is not magic, by bringing this tool we add some complex problems to a solution that was made to be simple to use.
The objective of this presentation is to show a real usecase of an international multi language client with very specific documents, how do we apply RAG in that case, 
what are the current limitations, what are the tools and the questions for tomorrow
