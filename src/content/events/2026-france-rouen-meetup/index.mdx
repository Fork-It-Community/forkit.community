      name: Live Editing Workshop
      description: >
        Join an interactive session where participants collaborate in small groups to make real-time edits on familiar places or pre-prepared examples. Depending on the size of the audience, we’ll split into 1, 2, or 3 groups to explore practical changes together.
        This hands-on workshop focuses on experimentation and collective creativity — participants will see their ideas come to life as we make genuine updates and improvements together.
