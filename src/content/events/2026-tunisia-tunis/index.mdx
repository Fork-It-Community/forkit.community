**Real talks, real experiences, real connections**. The [previous Tunis full-day Fork It! event](https://www.forkit.community/events/2025-tunisia-tunis) has been a blast! We are hosting a new one in April 2026 at the Cité de la Culture, just 6
weeks after [the full-day event in Hanoï](https://www.forkit.community/events/2026-vietnam-hanoi). Aiming to bring together professionals and creatives to share knowledge, learn from each other, and exchange ideas, around 200 participants will
be there.
A diverse lineup of **international and local speakers**, the conference will feature dynamic presentations and discussions, offering practical insights and real-world experiences.

Our goal is simple: to create a space for learning, collaboration, and meaningful conversations. With multilingual sessions, we aim to make the event accessible and inclusive,
fostering connections that matter.

**Join us and be part of the conversation.**
