After the success of [our previous meetups in Hanoï](https://www.forkit.community/events/locations/vietnam/hanoi) and full-day events across [France](https://www.forkit.community/events/locations/france), [Tunisia](https://www.forkit.community/events/locations/tunisia), and [Malaysia](https://www.forkit.community/events/locations/malaysia), Fork it! is coming back to Hanoï, Vietnam this March 2026 for a full-day conference in partnership with <a href="https://www.twendeesoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twendeesoft</a>.

We're gathering developers, tech enthusiasts, and curious minds for a day of authentic talks, fresh perspectives, and real-world experiences shared by people shaping today's tech scene.
You'll hear from both local and international speakers who will talk openly about their journeys : what worked, what didn't, and what they've learned along the way. Expect honest discussions, practical insights, and a community-driven atmosphere.

**Join us in Hanoï and be part of the Fork it! Community.**
