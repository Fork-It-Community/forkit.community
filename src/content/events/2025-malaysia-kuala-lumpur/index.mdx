After the success of our full-day events in **France** and **Tunisia**, **Fork It!** is coming to **Kuala Lumpur**, Malaysia this **October** at **Sunway University**.

We're bringing together a mix of tech lovers, creative minds, professionals, and curious people for a full day of real conversations, fresh ideas, and shared experiences.

You'll hear from **international** and **local** speakers who will talk honestly about what they've learned, what's worked (and what hasn't), and their real-life experiences in the tech world. It's the kind of honest feedback that can inspire you, challenge your thinking, and help you grow, whether you're just starting out or already deep in the game.

Come join us and be part of the **Fork It! community**.
