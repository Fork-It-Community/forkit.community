## Come by car

If you're driving, enter <a  href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/YymY9NKXrttixqnJ7" target="_blank"  rel="noreferrer" > Google Maps location</a>. This will take you directly to the university's parking entrance.

## Come by taxi
Use a ride-hailing app like **Grab** (widely used in Malaysia). 
Simply type **“Sunway University”** as your destination, and the driver will drop you off at the main campus entrance.

## By public transport
If you're coming by train or bus:
- The nearest station is **Sunway Lagoon** on the Kelana Jaya LRT line.
- From there, it's just a short 5-minute walk to the main entrance.
