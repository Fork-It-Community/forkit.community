You thought you'd feel quickly comfortable in your first dev jobâ€¦ but what happens when the project is huge and already halfway done?

In this talk, I'll share what it's like to join a big ongoing project for the first time, and how to work through it when everything feels out of control. From handling legacy code to managing your imposter syndrome, this talk focuses on real difficulties we all face and tips to overcome them.

You'll hear honest feedback on how to adapt quickly and find your place in a complex team environment. There are no easy answers or miracles, just lessons learned the hard way, and some good news: you're not alone.
