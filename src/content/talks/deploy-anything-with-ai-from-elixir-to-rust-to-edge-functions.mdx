What if AI could become your DevOps pair? In this session, we'll show how to build an AI-assisted deployment pipeline that understands your code
whether you're deploying a Phoenix app in Elixir, a Rust backend, or a serverless workload. Using LLMs, open-source agents, and CI/CD integrations, we'll
explore how to auto-generate Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, reverse proxy configs, and even sanity tests. This talk is about practical AI tooling for
real-world deployments, not just GitHub Copilot magic.
