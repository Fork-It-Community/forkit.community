In this talk, we'll explore building full-stack web applications powered by Astro, Astro Actions and Astro DB.
We'll start by discovering the basics of Astro, why and where it's useful, and how to build a web applications with it. We'll discover
 how to use Astro's new default hybrid rendering mode to add API routes and dynamic server-side rendering to the application.
Then we'll dive into Astro DB, a simple, yet powerful ORM used to communicate between a LibSQL database and your Astro application.
Also, Astro 5.0 has been released, we'll round up the talk by looking at how we can combine all of these features with a powerful headless
CMS like React Bricks.
