What if pixels could listen? In this talk, we'll explore the world of shaders through audio. Starting from the basics of fragment shaders,
 we'll learn how to bring visuals to life by making them react to sound. Like the glowing, pulsing animations you see in voice assistants such
 as Siri or Alexa. Step by step, we'll go from simple waveforms to dynamic animations that move with your voice or music. By the end, you'll
 understand how to turn raw audio input into real-time shader magic and leave with practical techniques to create your own sound-responsive visuals.
