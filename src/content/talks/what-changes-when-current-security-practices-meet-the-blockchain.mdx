Most software systems today are built with familiar security practices: trusted administrators, private infrastructure, controlled users, and the ability to fix problems after deployment.

Blockchain systems change many of these assumptions.

This talk shares real examples of what actually changes when current security practices are applied to blockchain-based systems, even when teams follow best practices and have experienced developers.

The first part of the talk is designed to be accessible to non-technical audiences. Through concrete stories from real projects, we'll explore how ideas like trust, responsibility, ownership, and incident handling evolve when software becomes public, immutable, and permissionless — without diving into technical details.

In the second part, we'll connect these ideas to real blockchain security incidents, showing how everyday decisions and processes led to unexpected failures once deployed on-chain, and what changes helped avoid repeating the same mistakes.

This is not a marketing talk and not a deep technical session. It's an honest, experience-based look at how security needs to be rethought when familiar software practices meet a very different execution environment.
