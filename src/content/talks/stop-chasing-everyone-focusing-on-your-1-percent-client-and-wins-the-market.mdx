When people invite me to share, they usually expect me to talk about property deals or market trends. That's where I spend most of my time. But this time, I want to take you behind the scenes of something different — my journey of building a CRM and property listing management website.

I started this project not because I was a tech founder, but because I was frustrated. Every day I saw agents, including myself, chasing after every lead, every call, every “maybe client.” We were running in circles, busy from morning till night, but results were unstable. The more we chased, the more drained we became.

So I asked myself: Is there a smarter way?

Building this system became my way of answering that question. Along the journey, I discovered something that completely shifted my mindset: you don't need everyone. You only need to focus on the 1% who really matter.

In this talk, I'll share how this realization came to me step by step:

The early mistakes I made by trying to build for “everyone.”

The turning point when I saw clearly who my real clients were.

How focusing on that 1% changed not just my project, but also my approach to business and life.

This is not just about a CRM system or some property tech tool. It's about learning to stop spreading yourself thin, and start building deeper, stronger relationships with the right people.

If you're someone who has been running non-stop, trying to keep up with everyone and everything — my journey might sound familiar. I'm here to tell you: there's another way. By focusing on your 1% clients, you can reduce stress, grow faster, and actually enjoy the work again.

At the end of this sharing, I hope you don't just walk away with a new idea about CRM or property listings, but with a mindset that helps you win the market without losing yourself.
