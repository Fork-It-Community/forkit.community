As digital transformation accelerates, organizations must evolve from reactive risk management to intelligence-driven foresight.
This forward-looking conference explores how OSINT methodologies, advanced cyber practices, and organizational OPSEC can be integrated
into security and compliance functions to anticipate threats before they materialize.

In addition to strengthening resilience, special emphasis will be placed on the protection of critical corporate assets including
intellectual property, strategic data, and C-level security against increasingly sophisticated cyber, human, and regulatory threats.

This conference delves into the critical intersection of cyber, human, and compliance risks, highlighting how corporate intelligence
acts as a strategic enabler to minimize uncertainty and drive informed decision-making. It explores the essential shift from reactive
risk management to proactive, intelligence-driven governance, relying on rigorous cultural foundations and companies transformation.
