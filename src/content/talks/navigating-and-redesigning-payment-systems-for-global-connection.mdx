​​Global payment systems are intended to connect us all, yet they often overlook the unique challenges faced by people in underserved economies. This talk dives into the creative ways Nigerians navigate and design payment solutions when major platforms fail to address local realities. For freelancers and entrepreneurs from Nigeria and other similar socioeconomic contexts, accessing international clients or services isn’t always straightforward. Traditional payment systems can be restrictive, making it difficult to send or receive funds, and global platforms often lack support for local currencies, banking structures, and reliable access.

​I will share insights from my personal experience as a freelancer from Nigeria, covering both the challenges and the ingenious, often community-driven solutions Nigerians have developed to thrive financially. From mobile banking innovations and peer-to-peer transactions to informal digital networks, these strategies reflect a deep cultural and technological adaptability.

​By examining how people work around these gaps, this talk will offer practical takeaways for designers and developers aiming to create more flexible and inclusive financial tools. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the resilience in these communities and learn how to incorporate similar adaptability, inclusivity, and human-centred thinking into global design solutions for payment systems.
