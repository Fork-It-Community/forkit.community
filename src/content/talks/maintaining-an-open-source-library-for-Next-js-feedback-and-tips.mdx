The introduction of the app router and React Server Components in Next.js brings an extra challenge for open-source maintainers of libraries based on this framework.
How can we ensure backwards compatibility on older versions? Are there pain points to look out for with new versions? What are the best practices we can put in place to help us stay sane along the way?
I'll present my experience adapting the nuqs library to support both the pages and app routers, with a deep-dive into how those routers work, their differences and history, and which led me to contribute to the Next.js project.
