Symfony 8 represents a major leap forward for the framework. As core team members, we've helped shape this evolution. As founders of baksla.sh, we've lived with the consequences of our architectural choices in production.

This dual perspective—framework development and real-world deployment—has taught us what truly matters when building enterprise applications with Symfony.

In this keynote, we'll share the patterns and practices that have emerged from this unique position: contributing to the framework while simultaneously pushing it to its limits on business-critical projects.

With Symfony 8.0 and PHP 8.5 both freshly released, the landscape of modern PHP architecture is shifting. We'll explore what's now possible and how to make strategic decisions that compound in your favor as your applications grow and evolve.

Join us to discover where Symfony is taking enterprise software development with its latest major version.
