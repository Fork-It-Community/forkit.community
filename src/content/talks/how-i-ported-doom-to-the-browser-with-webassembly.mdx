Porting video games allows for the discovery of new technologies while having fun. Additionally, it's an excellent entry point into the world of video game development. This is especially true thanks to WebAssembly, which simplifies the process of porting games to browsers.

During this session, I'll share my experiences with my first porting project. I'll explain why I chose to port Doom. Then, I'll demonstrate, step by step, how I successfully integrated the browser Canvas and AudioContext in JavaScript to achieve rendering that can reach up to 60 fps.

By the end of this conference, you'll see video game porting in a new light. So, if you're passionate about video games or wish to explore how WASM contributes to game porting, this session is for you.
