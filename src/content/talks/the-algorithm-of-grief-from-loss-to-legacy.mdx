Losing my mother to scleroderma redefined my life. Leaving my corporate career to care for her, I built Koyotec while coding through the night. Now, driven by her memory, I return to university to master machine learning. My goal: a classification model for the early detection of scleroderma, helping medicine know at the early stage. I'm exploring various architectures, likely a hybrid approach leveraging both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis of potential skin changes and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to analyze time-series data from patient records. The model will be trained on a carefully curated dataset, focusing on feature engineering to maximize sensitivity and specificity. This is my legacy, transforming grief into a future of hope.
