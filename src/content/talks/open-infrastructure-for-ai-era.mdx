This presentation introduces Open Infrastructure for the AI Era, highlighting how open-source technologies—led by OpenStack and the OpenInfra ecosystem—are emerging as a foundational platform for next-generation AI and HPC workloads. Drawing insights from the first OpenInfra for AI Working Group white paper, the talk explores reference architectures, best practices, and real-world use cases that demonstrate how open infrastructure can power AI training, inference, GPU-as-a-Service, MLOps platforms, high-performance computing clusters, and AI at the edge.

The session also shares practical experience from FPT Smart Cloud, a Vietnam-based contributor to the global OpenInfra for AI community, including lessons learned from deploying large-scale AI Factory clusters ranked in the Top 500 AI infrastructures worldwide. Key topics include GPU integration strategies (PCI passthrough, vGPU, MIG), high-performance storage and networking (RDMA, InfiniBand, SR-IOV), and system-level optimizations that unlock maximum performance from the same hardware.

By the end of this presentation, attendees will gain a clear understanding of why open, community-driven infrastructure is becoming a strategic enabler for AI innovation—reducing vendor lock-in, accelerating time to market, and creating new opportunities for global collaboration and “Make in Vietnam” AI platforms in the global AI economy.
