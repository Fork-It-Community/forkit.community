This talk explores the journey of launching a Web3 startup in Malaysia, delving into the unique opportunities and challenges within the region's evolving digital landscape. We will cover the essentials of Web3 technologies such as blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, communities and how they can be leveraged to create innovative startups.
