AI-powered coding tools have dramatically changed the way we write software. Today, generating large amounts of code is as simple as describing what we want. While _Vibe Coding_ can boost short-term productivity, it also introduces a serious risk: writing and deploying code we do not truly understand — a growing concern for many companies.

AI is a game-changer, and developers must adapt. However, embracing AI does not mean giving up understanding. On the contrary, it offers an opportunity to learn differently and potentially faster.

In this talk, we explore how AI can become a learning partner rather than a blind code generator. We will discuss how developers can utilize AI to gain a deeper understanding of algorithms, language-specific nuances, performance trade-offs, and design decisions.
By asking the right questions, code generation becomes a **powerful learning tool**.

By shifting from **_Vibe Coding_** to **_Vibe Learning_**, developers can regain control over their codebases, enhance their skills, and build more robust and maintainable software.
