Video games are not limited to what the vast majority of people define it to be. Especially as a game developer in a third world country where a lot of development is out sourced. Had the chance to work on so many video games made for purposes other than Entertainment. All kind of serious games in health, education, training and more. Advergames to advertise products and brands and other. I'll explain to you how I had to go through all of this, before having the opportunity to work on games built for the sake of having fun.
