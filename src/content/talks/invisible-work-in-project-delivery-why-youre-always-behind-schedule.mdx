Ever felt like you're constantly behind schedule, even though you're coding all day?

In outsourcing environments, delivery delays often aren't caused by bad code or lazy developers - they're caused by invisible work. This is the untracked, underestimated, or misunderstood effort that eats away at your timeline: clarifying vague requirements, preparing test data, resolving blockers across time zones, handling last-minute scope creep, endless feedback cycles, or even just waiting on access permissions.

In this talk, we'll dissect what invisible work looks like in real outsourced software projects. You'll learn how to spot it early, how to reduce it through better workflows and hand-offs, and how to communicate its impact with clients and stakeholders. Expect real war stories, delivery patterns, and tactical advice to stop being blindsided by things “nobody planned for”.
