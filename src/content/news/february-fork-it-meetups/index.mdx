Following a successful year of global tech meetups, Fork it! Community returns this February with events in Tunisia and Thailand. Expect insightful talks on Java, refactoring, UX, and cybersecurity. Whether you're looking to **learn, connect, or 
share your expertise**, this is the perfect opportunity to engage with fellow developers and industry leaders.

But why do we organize these meetups? What drives us to bring developers together across different continents? Let‚Äôs take a step back and explore the vision behind Fork it! Community meetups.

## Why We Organize Fork it! Meetups  

Fork it! Community believes in **creating spaces for meaningful discussions, experience sharing and real-world problem-solving**.  

**Why?**  
- **Breaking isolation:** Whether you‚Äôre a junior or senior developer, it‚Äôs easy to get stuck in your own bubble. Meetups give you **a fresh perspective** and introduce you to new tools, practices, and people.  
- **Practical over theoretical:** We prioritize **real-world insights over abstract concepts**. Talks are designed to be actionable, with takeaways you can apply in your projects.  
- **Building strong local and global tech communities:** Meetups in **Tunisia, Thailand, and beyond** create bridges between developers worldwide, sharing different experiences and challenges.
