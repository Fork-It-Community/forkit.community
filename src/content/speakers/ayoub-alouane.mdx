I am Ayoub Alouane, 29 years old, working as a DevRel and TechLead in Adservio, Moroccan coming from Africa, starting a new journey in France,
I had my first experience as a speaker in Devoxx France, I'm trying to build a consciousness about performance in our community of devs, I'm interested in Qwik
Framework because I think that is the best Framework in term of performance using the concept of Resumability. I'm one of the leaders of the community of Qwik
in the world and I'm trying to do what I can to convince people that performance matters.
